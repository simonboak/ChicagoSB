# Chicago SB - A pixel font for OLED and LCD displays

## Inspired by your favourite personal computer and music player interfaces

Font was created by hand with [Fony](http://hukka.ncn.fi/?fony) and is found in `src/ChicagoSB-12.fon`. Closer to the original 12 pixel Chicago than is achieved by running a vector font through a converter.

The following exported/converted formats for use with display libraries:

- `ChicagoSB-12.bdf`
- `ChicagoSB_12.c` use this for [u8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2)
- `ChicagoSB_12.py` for Python modules such as [Peter Hinch's writer.py](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-font-to-py/blob/master/writer/writer.py)
